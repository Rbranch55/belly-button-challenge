# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

From there I:
- Used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json
- Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
